# Stonehenge VR Experience

A **virtual reality experience** where you can explore a simplified reconstruction of **Stonehenge** using your **Meta Quest** browser.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is **not an accurate historical reconstruction** of Stonehenge. The experience is designed as a **learning project** for working with **A-Frame**, a framework for building VR environments in the browser.

## 🌍 How to Access
To enter the virtual world, simply open this link in your **Meta Quest** browser:

🔗 **[Stonehenge VR Experience](https://feulalorenzo.github.io/Stonehenge/)**

## 🏗️ About the Model
- The original **3D model** is included in the project files.
- The model has been **simplified using Blender** to reduce the number of polygons and improve performance, minimizing lag in the VR environment.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **A-Frame** – A web framework for building VR experiences.
- **Blender** – Used for model optimization and decimation.
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting the experience online.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created as a **learning exercise** in developing **VR applications with A-Frame**. The main objectives were:
- Understanding **basic scene creation** in A-Frame.
- Optimizing **3D assets for web-based VR**.
- Hosting and deploying a VR project using **GitHub Pages**.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Adding **interactivity** (e.g., movement, object inspection).
- Enhancing **textures and lighting** for better realism.
- Implementing **audio** for an immersive experience.
